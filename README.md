# Accelerater-Framework

This Repo contains a lightweight working build of the Azure Platform Accelerator. Figure 1 contains the step-by-step needed to stand-up the platform from scratch using scripts in the Powershell and ARM deployments folder. 

* Tutorial contains in-depth set-up docs
* Weekly Sessions contain weekly learning topics around the framework
* Note that there are two total databricks environments and the ReadMe in the Azure Databricks Notebooks folder lists this in detail.
* A zipped file of a working Framework Database is located in Framework SQLDB. This can be stood-up using visual studio deployments located at the root of the folder
